=Relay Controller Board Build Tutorial:=


Quantity of the components depends upon how many channels you want e.g. if you want to control more than one light then you will have to add that much number of relays on your controller board. 


Here is the material list which will be needed to build the board:
(Quantity of the components given for making 1 channel relay controller)




|| *Sr.No* || *Component Names* || *Quantity* ||
|| 1 || Relay (I have used GOODSKY RWH-SH-105D Relay) || 1 ||
|| 2 || Transistor 2N3904 || 1 ||
|| 3 || 1K Resistor || 2 ||
|| 4 || 10K Resistor || 1 ||
|| 5 || 1N4148 Diode  || 1 ||
|| 6 || Red Led 3mm  || 1 ||
|| 7 || 3 Pin PCB Mount Connector || 1 ||
|| 8 || 1 Pin PCB Mount Connector || 1 ||

Here in the circuit diagram Pin no.2 will be connected to the arduino control output pin and other two will be connected to +5V and Gnd accordingly.


After soldering all of your components according to the above circuit diagram the board should look like this.

This is single relay controller board. You can extend this to as many as you want. I have made 5 channel relay controller board as below.
