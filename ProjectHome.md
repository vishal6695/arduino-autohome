## **Introduction:** ##


I have started doing this project to create a good and inexpensive home Automation System at your fingertip and plus its much more fun for DIY Hobbyist.

I will be updating project report time to time with required images, videos and codes.
If anybody have any modification ideas or suggestions then please do comment so that required changes will be carried out.

## How Does it Work ##

The main brain for this project is Arduino UNO Board along with Arduino Ethernet Shield to give it a wireless connectivity.Arduino runs a code to control a Relay board according to the input and also serves a web page through which respective output to the relay board can be controlled.Through relay controller board we can control lamps, tubes or any AC power sockets.


## Future Goal ##

Right now we can control Realy control board only through Ethernet connectivity following control means are under work:

1. Infrared control (almost completed, code will be updated soon)


2. Wifi Control (under work)


3. Celluler Control



**Note:** You can start with project by Reading Wiki section of this project
