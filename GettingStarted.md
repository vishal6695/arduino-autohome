But I will recommend you to build your own since it saves money gives you an actual working idea and plus you can add as much as relays according to your requirement.


6.Good Soldering Iron


7.Soldering Wire


8.Soldering Flux


9.Breadboard (for testing of circuit before soldering)


10.General Purpose PCB


This is the list for important components you should have with you to get started with the project.
