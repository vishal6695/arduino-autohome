# Setting Up Arduino IDE #




Now first of all you should have an Arduino IDE it is free Arduino compiler. You can go on the link and download it to your system.


For windows: http://arduino.googlecode.com/files/arduino-1.0.1-windows.zip


For Mac OS X: http://arduino.googlecode.com/files/arduino-1.0.1-macosx.zip


For Linux 32 Bit: http://arduino.googlecode.com/files/arduino-1.0.1-linux.tgz


For Linux 64 Bit: http://arduino.googlecode.com/files/arduino-1.0.1-linux64.tgz


The open-source Arduino environment makes it easy to write code and upload it to the i/o board. It runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. The environment is written in Java and based on Processing, avr-gcc, and other open source software.
After you finish downloading make a Folder in C Drive Program Files with the name “Arduino” and extract all content of the download source in this folder and you are ready to go.


Here is the link to the video which explain about Arduino and how to use it.
